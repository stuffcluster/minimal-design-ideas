W﻿orking on instances of \`note\` as a content type, testing and analysing different ways the data might be presented, it occurs to me that it needs a more clearly articulated specification. Here are some properties of \`note\` that aren't adequately captured in its current form:

* The notes I'm writing are all framed as assertions, but they needn't be. They could be questions, links to external articles, imaginary conversations, quotes, images&mldr; whatever captures the thought. 
* M﻿y notes look like principles, but I don't intend for them to be accepted at face value, even if they happen to sound convincing. A \`note\` is something in need of further refinement; it could be completely wrong.
* B﻿ecause people have different styles, the \`note\` should include the author's identity.
* T﻿here should be a maximum input to encourage focused expression of the idea.
* E﻿ach note should have its own page. This allows interlinking and all kinds of other possibilities.
